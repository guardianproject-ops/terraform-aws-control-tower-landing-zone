description: Terraform module for managing the AWS Control Tower Landing Zone

introduction: |-
  Deploy your AWS Control Tower Landing Zone with terraform.

  This module can also be used on management accounts that already have AWS Control Tower Landing Zone enabled, see the documentation below.

usage: |-

  ```terraform
  module "control_tower_landing_zone" {
    source = "git::https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-control-tower-landing-zone?ref=main"
    email_address_account_audit        = "admin+aws-audit@example.com"
    email_address_account_log_archiver = "admin+aws-logs@example.com"
    governed_regions = [
      "eu-central-1",
      "us-east-1"
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## How to import landing zones that already exist

  You should be able to import your existing landing zone using this module without ANY changes/deletions when executing the apply.

  1. Use the [`generate_imports.py`][generate_imports] script included in our [`terraform-aws-account-baseline-root`][baseline-root] module
      * You might need to edit the script to fit your use case and org setup, that's fine, it's a one off thing.
      * That script also generates imports for our baseline root module, if you aren't using that then you should delete those extra imports
  2. Use the generated file along with a module statement like outlined previously as the basis for your terraform config
  3. Execute a terraform plan.
  4. Tweak imports and input variables, don't forget `existing_key_arn`
  5. Repeat 3 - 4 until there are zero modifications, creations (see exceptions), or deletions

  [baseline-root]: https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-baseline-root
  [generate_imports]: https://gitlab.com/guardianproject-ops/terraform-aws-account-baseline-root/-/blob/main/generate_imports.py?ref_type=heads

  The exception to #5 is that the `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` resource will be created, this is OK!

  If you see ANY changes/creations/deletions except 4x `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` creations, then STOP and investigate.

  ## How to upgrade the AWS Control Tower Landing Zone version

  Simply edit the `landing_zone_version` input variable.

  Refer to [Configuration update management in AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/configuration-updates.html) documentation for more information.

  ## How to enable `Region deny control`

  The `Region deny control` can't be enabled via the AWS API, so it cannot be IaCed. To enable it you need to:

  1.  Open the AWS Control Tower console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/controltower/
  2.  In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.
  3.  In the **Region deny control** section, choose **Edit**.
  4.  Select the **Enable region deny control** check box.
  5.  Choose **Save**.
